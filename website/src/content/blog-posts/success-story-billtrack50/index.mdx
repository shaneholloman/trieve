## About BillTrack50

BillTrack50 is the search engine for democracy. The platform is the OS for the nation’s non-profits, advocacy groups, and corporate government affairs departments. A competitive space, the BillTrack50 development team works hard to unlock advantages and leverage for their customers, at scale.

BillTrack50’s values are evident in their free Citizen tier, where anyone can empower themselves with historical and current legislation to direct and inform their action in our democracy. After reaching out and connecting on a desire to use AI to make bill discovery and tracking 10x easier, they engaged with Trieve to make it happen.

## AI Goals

One of the core experiences to the BillTrack50 platform is to discover and track bills relevant to their interests. With tens of thousands of new bills to discover every legislative cycle, organizations were spendings countless hours per year manually querying for bills related to theirs. Not to mention the anxiety of being uncertain one has discovered all of the relevant bills and that one has not slipped past their filters and keywords.

Simply put, there are ways to write legislation about 'gun control' or 'abortion' without the bill actually containing these words. Vectors can be very powerful here, when done correctly. The goal was to create an 'easy button' for users to find bills similar to a given piece of legislation with a single click.

With most of the support being done over email, it took the team one sprint to build, test, evaluate the Trieve-based solution against others, and deploy it to a smaller group of customers. After a successful trial period, it was immediately well-received by the greater userbase.\\
