## About Mintlify

Mintlify is the modern standard for documentation. With its developer-forward product, they make it easy to build beautiful documentation whether you're a large enterprise or just getting started.

Trieve itself is a proud Mintlify customer: checkout the [docs](https://docs.trieve.ai) here.

After reaching out and discussing their technical requirements and desired outcomes for search and RAG, we engaged to support the team's build.

## Building, Evaluating, and Implementing

We first built a [proof-of-concept](https://mintlify.trieve.ai) for the Mintlify team to evaluate the out-of-the-box search quality of Trieve. After drawing out an implementation and proof schedule, it took the team one sprint to build, test, evaluate the Trieve-based solution against others, and deploy it to a smaller group of customers.

After a successful testing period, large-scale search improvements [launched](https://mintlify.com/blog/launch-week-3-day-2) as part of Mintlify's Summer launch week.

Because Trieve is an all-in-one solution, control over chunking, highlighting, and analytics give the team extra levers and knobs to ensure customer satisfaction. Since then, Trieve-powered RAG has been rolled out as well.
