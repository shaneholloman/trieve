## About Flaviar

Flaviar isn't just an e-commerce platform; it's the nation's—and quite possibly the world's—premier destination for wine and spirits. Since its founding in 2011 by Jugoslav Petkovic, Matija Rijavec, and Grisa Soba, Flaviar has become a true ecommerce unicorn, known for its innovation and success.

With a **curated selection** of rare and exclusive bottles, Flaviar offers members a unique journey of discovery through the world of fine beverages. Its innovative **tasting boxes** and personalized recommendations further elevate the experience, making it much more than just a place to buy drinks.

## A Discerning AI for a Discerning Audience: How Trieve and Flaviar Teamed Up

Flaviar built its business on a deep understanding of its customers and products. Long before the current creator economy, they made an early bet on serving knowledgeable consumers who are constantly in the loop. This strategy has paid off, compounding over the years into a brand synonymous with reliability, quality, and a fiercely loyal community. When we connected with their team about integrating AI features, their forward-thinking culture was a perfect match for ours.

The challenge for Flaviar was clear: how to embrace the AI wave while maintaining their consistently on-brand, positive customer experience.

## In Their Own Words

**Vasja Fužir, Lead Product Manager at Flaviar, shares his perspective:**

> ***Trieve has genuinely transformed how our shoppers navigate the store**. Their AI chat guides product discovery in a way that feels natural, intuitive, and genuinely helpful. From day one, their team has been incredibly responsive and proactive. **They’ve acted like true partners, not just vendors—bringing ideas to the table, iterating fast**, and helping us get real value quickly.*

> *The tech lives up to its promise: personalized product suggestions, intelligent answers to shopper questions, and a smooth path from search to checkout. It adapts seamlessly to our catalog, syncs with our brand voice, and reduces the load on our support team—**all without requiring heavy setup on our end**.*

This partnership ensures Flaviar remains at the forefront of AI innovation, with Trieve continuously delivering cutting-edge features that adapt to evolving market demands and customer expectations.

## The Work & Results: Introducing Uncle Flaviar

We collaborated intensely with Flaviar to launch **Uncle Flaviar**, a sitewide, branded, and savvy AI concierge. Its sole purpose? To help customers discover the products they truly want—or better yet, the ones they didn't even know they needed.

Uncle Flaviar has consistently delivered a **5-figure monthly increase in revenue**. We've observed that simple, effective "Quick Queries" like "Bottles to treat myself" or "Surprise me!" do wonders. They:

1. **Create momentum** in the purchasing journey.
2. **Turn curiosity into purchase intent.**
3. **Convert purchase intent into add-to-carts** with brief, compelling descriptions tailored to each product.

Beyond product discovery, **Trieve's advanced capabilities mean it can ingest your specific policies, return rules, and other critical business logic.** This allows the AI to accurately answer common "Where Is My Order?" (WISMO) and other customer service questions, further reducing support load and ensuring consistent, on-brand information delivery.

We're incredibly grateful to Flaviar and their customers for entrusting us with their queries. We remain committed to delivering the latest in enterprise-grade AI, as we've done for millions of searchers.

If you're looking to fill an AI-shaped gap in your business, we'd love to connect.
