  title: Trieve delivers modern GenAI capabilities that Algolia lacks
  description: >-
    Unlike Algolia's rules-based approach, Trieve brings modern GenAI to your store. We're rated higher on Shopify (5/5 vs 3.6/5 stars) and pack amazing features like store-wide AI discovery and product page Q&A that Algolia just doesn't have. While Algolia shines at visual merchandising, Trieve focuses on delivering cutting-edge AI capabilities that make your store smarter and more engaging.
