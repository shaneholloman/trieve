SAN FRANCISCO, CA (September 11, 2024) - We at Trieve are thrilled to announce our oversubscribed $3.5M round led by Root Ventures! Our backers include Y Combinator, Soma Capital, Kulveer Taggar, Transpose Platform, and a distinguished group of strategic angel investors such as JJ Fliegelman, Richard Aberman, Rajiv Ayyangar, Jenny Fleiss, and Rohan Das.

[Myself](https://github.com/skeptrunedev) and [Denzell Ford](https://github.com/cdxker) founded Trieve because we wanted infrastructure purpose-built for AI. Trieve makes it easy for developers building AI applications to determine which retrieval techniques best fit their problem and productionize with confidence.

We are looking to power every industry building with AI. New generations of discovery technology are revolutionizing user experiences and we are on the frontier.

This fresh injection of capital will be directed towards bolstering our sales strategy and strengthening customer success outcomes across e-commerce, ERP, social media platforms, and beyond. With current customers like Mintlify, BillTrack50, and AmLaw100 Firms, over 16,000 search bars are powered by Trieve.

Lee Edwards, our lead partner from Root Ventures, and us share a frustration and desire to enable quality retrieval across the internet: "Everyone thinks in-app search sucks, and that's because we are used to the intelligent, AI-based search that has improved over time from search engines like Google. But inside apps, even the large incumbents aren't doing much more than text matching. RAG and other AI-based techniques deliver the kind of user experience that can actually help products see lift from their search features, and Trieve makes these advanced techniques easy for any engineering team to implement."

I am grateful to our partners, team, community, and customers. We will continue to build the best-possible retrieval infrastructure with hacker spirit! Star us at [github.com/devflowinc/trieve](https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve)!
