# Trieve CLI

A command-line interface for interacting with the Trieve API. The CLI enables users to upload files, check upload status, ask questions against their knowledge base, and configure their Trieve setup.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g trieve-cli
```

## Configuration

Before using the CLI, you need to configure it with your Trieve credentials:

```bash
trieve configure
```

This interactive command will prompt you for:

- Your Trieve Organization ID
- Your Trieve Dataset ID
- Your Trieve API Key
- User ID (for topic ownership)

Alternatively, you can set these as environment variables:

- `TRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- `TRIEVE_DATASET_ID`
- `TRIEVE_API_KEY`

## Commands

### Upload Files

Upload a file to your Trieve dataset:

```bash
trieve upload [filePath] [-t, --tracking-id <trackingId>]
```

If no file path is provided, the CLI will prompt you to enter one interactively.

### Check Upload Status

Check the status of your uploaded files:

```bash
trieve check-upload-status [-t, --tracking-id <trackingId>]
```

Without options, this will display an interactive menu to select files to check. If a tracking ID is provided, it will check the status of that specific file.

### Ask Questions

Ask a question against your Trieve dataset:

```bash
trieve ask [question]
```

If no question is provided, the CLI will prompt you to enter one interactively. The response will be streamed back with reference information that you can expand by pressing 'j'.

### Update Tool Configuration

Customize the RAG system prompt and tool configurations:

```bash
trieve update-tool-config [-t, --tool-description <toolDescription>] [-q, --query-description <queryDescription>] [-s, --system-prompt <systemPrompt>]
```

This allows you to customize:

- Tool description: Instructions for when the LLM should use the search tool
- Query description: How the LLM should formulate search queries
- System prompt: Custom system prompt for the AI assistant

## Features

# Update the tool configuration for more specific search behavior
trieve update-tool-config --query-description "Create precise search queries focusing on technical terms and definitions"
```
