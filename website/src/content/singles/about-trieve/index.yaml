  title: Our Story
  content: >-
    Trieve was founded at the FUTO campus in Austin, TX in 2023. FUTO generously
    provided both open source grant funding—allowing us to quit our jobs—and
    office space to hack at with no limits. With discovery as our mission, our
    first development was a litigation discovery tool for managing large
    e-discovery document dumps. In fact, some of our original Big Law clients
    remain with us to this day.


    We soon identified broader problem with modern AI retrieval and applied to Y
    Combinator to pivot toward providing a developer platform. Pete Koomen
    believed in our vision and invited us to join the program. We shifted our
    focus to building the best discovery API possible. In September 2024, we
    raised $3.5M to improve search capabilities across the internet. Today, we
    serve over 5,000 accounts, including fast-growing startups, unicorns, and
    publicly traded companies like Mintlify, Vapi, Guardant, Flaviar, and more.


    While our approach is AI-native, we are fundamentally a team of humans. We
    remain committed to transparency and building high-quality, long-term
    relationships with both our customers and end-users.
